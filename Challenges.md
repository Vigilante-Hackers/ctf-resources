# Challenges

Usually any good CTF will have plenty of good challenges which will be fairly
educational as well. A good way to track upcoming CTFs will be 
[ctftime](https://ctftime.org/). They also have a public google calendar that
you can follow to keep track of upcoming CTFs.

Apart from upcoming CTFs, there are many websites that have CTF questions for 
practice. The ones below are generic ones, you can go to topic specific 
directories to get resources and challenges for specific topics.

## PicoGYM

[PicoGYM](https://picoctf.org/index.html#picogym) is an initiative by Carnegie
Mellon University to provide a collection of challenges. While mostly containing
questions that came previously on picoCTF, they have amassed a significant 
variety of questions and is a good place to learn and practice for new 
questions.

## HackTheBox

[HackTheBox](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/) is also a great place to give CTFs and 
practice. Their CTFs are of amazing quality and cover a vast array of topics and
difficulty levels. 

## TryHackMe

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/practice) is another great and
beginner friendly resource to practice questions. They have many starter *rooms*
to serve as a gentle introduction to topics.
