# Capture The Flag

A **Capture The Flag** is a kind of a cybersecurity and information security 
competition where competitors are primarily supposed to retrieve a *string* of 
text called the *flag*. They are primarily of two kinds, jeopardy and 
attack-defense, though many competitions also mix these two.

A jeopardy style CTF is often the most common form. It involves challenges, 
often in categories. Points are gained for every solve. Scoring mechanism 
varies, but two common types are observed:
- static: The points stay the same regardless of the number of teams that solve
  it.
- dynamic: The points *decay* with each team that solves it. They may decay in
  any fashion but inverse with the number of teams is the most common strategy.


An attack-defense CTF is often more involved, where teams usually build services
or software that are then attacked by other teams. Each team gets defense points
if their services are safe against an attack, and attack points for every 
service that they are able to exploit.

## Why CTFs

CTFs are a good way to build your skills and learn fundamentals of cybersecurity 
in a fun and engaging fashion. Many professionals in cybersecurity build their 
knowledge through CTFs.

## How to navigate this repository

This repository contains resources and tools for anything that relates to a CTF.
These are subdivided into folders, each of which touches upon a certain subtopic
and has resources for those.
