# How to learn Binary Exploitation

There are many methods to learn binary exploitation. However, it often requires
special guidance and resources for people to learn it well and thoroughly.

- The most famous resource, **The Art Of Exploitation** is a book by Jon
Erickson, which covers this in amazing detail and depth. Note, however, that it
can be extremely dry and boring to read, and occasionally skips content for the
sake of brevity.
[PDFs](https://archive.org/details/hackingtheartofexploitation_202003/mode/2up)
are easily available online. This book assumes no prior background, so that's a
great thing.

- Cybersecurity Club of IIT Madras also has a playlist of it's binary
exploitation lectures on youtube [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVRjFGMO1MSj7qcUzZOC7uW2VPfDpdRpy&si=vH4p90kKFoYOhvaT).
These assume prior background in C and linux CLI.

- Arizona State University maintains and runs [pwn.college](pwn.college), again
an awesome platform for learning resources and challenges. Nothing except for a
browser is needed to practice, they have attack boxes where you can connect and
try the challenges out.

- [My blog](innocent_zero.codeberg.page) often has posts about binary
exploitation and ELFs in general which clear concepts.

- And of course, writeups for various binary exploitation challenges are a good
way to learn things.
